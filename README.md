# Pizza-Ordering-Program
This is a simple program that calculates the final bill for a pizza order based on user preferences. 
## The program asks the user for:
- Pizza size ( Small, Medium, Large)
- Wether they want pepperoni
- Wether they want extra cheese

It then calculates the total cost and displays the final bill.

## Pizza Pricing:
- Small pizza (S): $15
- Medium pizza (M): $20
- Large pizza (L): $25
## Pepperoni
- Small pizza: +$2
- Medium/Large pizza: +$3
## Extra cheese
- Any size: +$1

## What I learnt:
- Using "input()" to get user input
- Performing calculations with conditional logic
- Using variables to store and update tools
- Writing clear and readable code
